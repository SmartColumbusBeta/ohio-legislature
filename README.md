## District Maps:
- To find your district and the representative who represents you, refer to the map above.
- Or search for your representative by name, district number or zip code on the bottom left corner of the [The Ohio House of Representatives homepage](https://http://www.ohiohouse.gov/).

### :worried: But what about The Ohio Senate?
- You can click [Find Your Senator](http://www.ohiosenate.gov/senators/district-map) and enter your address to find your district on their map.
  - Please note: entering only your ZIP code (or ZIP + 4) could produce an inaccurate result.
  
### :weary: And then there's the United States House of Representatives...
- Click Ohio on the [View Representatives by State](https://www.house.gov/representatives#state-ohio) map.
   - This leads to a directory, not a district map.
   
### :disappointed: Is there anywhere I can see these districts mapped together?

### :astonished: Yes!
- This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python 3 code allowing me to see the State of Ohio and how these 3 distinct district maps overlay!
